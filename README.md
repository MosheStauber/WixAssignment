To-Do list http server for at home assignment

The assignment was to build an HTTP server for a to-do list app.  
The server was to expose methods to add and item, delete an item, retrieve all items and show logs of all updates.  

The server was built using `sun.net.httpserver` and `HttpHandlers` without a framework.  
The database is hosted by **Amazon Web Services** using their **Relational Database Service**  

To run the server, you can import the project into netbeans and just press run. Then go localhost:9000 in your web browser.

The saerver can also be run by starting the dist/ToDoListHttpServer.jar file and going localhost:9000 in your web browser.
